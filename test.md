### The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner
#### by Daniel Ellsberg
##### Bloomsbury, 420 pp. $30.00

Daniel Ellsberg in his youth and Daniel Ellsberg in his age are the same man—a born worrier quick to spot trouble, take alarm, and _issue warning_. He is best known for **worrying** about the American war in Vietnam, which time in the war zone convinced him was a crime, and for doing what he could to bring it to an end.^[footnote]

In that case he copied and illegally released a huge collection of secret documents about the war, first published in June 1971 by The New York Times, which came to be known as the Pentagon Papers.

But Vietnam was not the first or the biggest thing that worried Ellsberg after he went to work in his late twenties as an analyst for the RAND Corporation in 1959.

<!-- His first and biggest worry was the American effort to defend itself with nuclear weapons.  -->

When Ellsberg finally got a look at the plans for such a war he realized immediately that the Strategic Air Command had built a military instrument that not only *could* but in his view probably *would* break the back of human civilization.

- It was Vietnam that got in the way of his plan to do something about the nuclear war plans. In his new memoir, _The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner_, the second about the big things that obsessed Ellsberg in his youth, he does not try to explain why he set aside worry about the bomb to tackle America’s hopeless war in Southeast Asia, then in its sixth year.
- The probable answer is that he had gone to see it. Arguing about nuclear weapons with other supersmart young analysts and Air Force colonels was dismaying but not horrifying in the way of war itself. In Vietnam hundreds of Americans and thousands of Vietnamese were dying every month, and sometimes every week, with no end in sight. The commitment of American policymakers to go on killing peasants rather than confess failure was the crime that Ellsberg felt impelled to expose and denounce.
